### Course Philosophy

Visualization is important to most areas of science, engineering, and medicine. Accordingly, students in this course have a 
variety of backgrounds, expertises, and needs. We will try to cover topics common to many areas of visualization, 
while, at the same time, allowing individuals to learn specific techniques and/or applications via a visualization project. 
Scientific visualization can be approached from an abstract and/or from a practical perspective. In this course, 
we’ll focus on applications in science, engineering, and medicine, while at the same time learning some of the underlying theory.

### Learning Outcomes. Upon completion of CS 5635 / CS 6635, the student should:
* know commonly used algorithms and techniques in scientific visualization,
* have seen and discussed examples of visualization techniques and be able to apply them  in a variety of fields,
* be able to critique the effectiveness of a scientific visualization and propose improvements if needed,
* be able to efficiently use an advanced scientific visualization software system,
* know where to locate and use further visualization resources,
* be knowledgable of current research challenges in scientific visualization and understand in which application they emerge,
* have demonstrated the ability to define and execute a project in scientific visualization. 
    
### Assignments
There are two main types of assignments for this course. One is in the form of in between class homework that will primarily 
consist of using the [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) and [OpenViSUS](https://visus.org/) visualization software systems. 
The second will be in the form of a scientific visualization project. This project can be a visualization of data you have collected 
from a simulation and/or experiment, development of a new software tool(s) for visualization, or a theoretical investigation 
of a topic in visualization. The goal is to supply the student with a hands on experience that is as close to real life 
applications as possible within the confines of a semester long class.
Languages: While we will primarily use the ParaView and OpenViSUS visualization systems, ParaView is built upon the 
Visualization Toolkit (vtk), which has versions in C++, Java, and Python, while OpenViSUS has versions in C++, and Python. 
We expect students to be able to program in Python for some assignments.

### Grades
Final course grades will be computed according to 80% Homework and 20% Final Project.
Incompletes: As the project is due by the end of the semester, in past similar project-based courses, 
it has turned out that some people do not wisely schedule their time and do not finish their projects. 
They then want to take an incomplete and finish the project sometime in the summer. 
We only give incompletes very rarely and only for truly unusual circumstances (death in the family, etc.), 
so please plan carefully and work to finish your final project on time.
