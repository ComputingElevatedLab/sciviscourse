### Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to Scientific Visualization techniques used for the effective presentation of data from a variety of disciplines including medicine, engineering, physics and biology. Students will learn about the use of fundamental approaches (color map selection, isocontouring, volume rendering, streamlines, etcâ€¦), as well as efficient algorithms for their computation. Special emphasis will be given to the correctness of the results provided, and the reliability of the insight provided to the users/scientists. In the study of visualization algorithms we will emphasize the selection of efficient data structures, complexity analysis, practical efficiency, and verification of the quality of the output generated. Successful completion of the course will enable the students pursuing new research directions in this field as well as applying the most recent visualization techniques for the presentation of data from simulations and experiments and aid the users in the science discovery process.

 
### Prerequisites 

There are no formal prerequisites for this class. Students will be expected to have basic knowledge of geometric data structures and algorithmic techniques.
